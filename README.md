repositor for bestosotech link.

This is the code from my post over at http://bestosotech.com/blog.php?tab=Code&selected=1&page=(ASM) Hello World - Linux x64 Intel Using nasm

I posted this verson of my hello world as a display piece.

This program prints Hello World to your linux terminal's screen, then safely stops execution by exiting the program. 

Feel free to use this as a base for any experienments you may have.
